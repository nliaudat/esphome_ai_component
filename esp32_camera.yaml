  # Image Settings
  # - these first 5 parameters can only be set by recompiling the code and uploading it to the esp32
  # - this is NOT a limitation of the esp32_camera component.
  #   These parameters are used to define the frame_buffer that captures the images.
  #      And the frame_buffer can't be changed after the setup() function has run.
  # 2024-12-20: setup() calls esp_camera_init(), which is defined in
  #   https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera/blob/4335c93ec462a379aa2a3d655b8834972d725190/driver/include/esp_camera.h
  #   the comments at the start of this function's definition clearly state that:
  #     - it can only be called once
  #     - it setups the framebuffer (which uses these first 5 parameters)
  #     - and it cannot be de-initialized once it is set
  #   Therefore, changing these parameters on the fly will have no effect
  #   Perhaps this will get changed at some point
